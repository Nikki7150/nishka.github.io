      <h3 id="h31">Hi! I'm Nishka. I am also a student who went through "the move". I moved to the US from India right after my sophomore year and I had a really hard time trying to catch up with my peers. I understand how hard it can be to adjust to a new school system, language, and culture after moving to a new country. It can make you feel very uncertain and confused. </h3>
      
      <img id="abt2" alt="A girl and two boys sitting together and studying surrounded by school books." src="assets/group.jpg">
      <h3 id="h32">The problem I am addressing is many immigrant and first generation students face barriers in education. Including lack of access to resources, cultural and language challenges, and limited guidance on college pathways. These students offer struggle to navigate the US school system without the support networks or knowledge that others may take for granted. As a result, they may feel isolated, overwhelmed or fall behind academically</h3>
      
      <img id="abt3" alt="A girl sitting on a bench looking at her laptop in a hopeful expression." src="assets/hopeful.jpg">
      <h3 id="h33">I want to help other students like me feel less alone and more confident as they navigate school and plan their future. Many students donâ€™t know where to find help, so I want to create a space that gives them the tools and support they need to succeed. By sharing experiences and creating a supportive space while also acquiring helpful tools to help them, I hope to make them feel seen, understood, and empowered. </h3>
